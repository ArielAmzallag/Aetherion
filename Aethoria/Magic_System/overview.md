# Magic System Overview: The Dual Forces

## Fundamental Nature
Magic in Aethoria stems from the interplay between two primordial forces:
- Entropy (Chaos Force): Change, creation, destruction, possibility
- Stasis (Order Force): Preservation, structure, stability, pattern

## Source of Power
Magical energy emerges from the tension between these forces, manifesting as:
- Aether: Raw magical energy
- Ley Lines: Natural flows of magical force
- Nodes: Concentrations of either force
- Rifts: Areas of force imbalance

## Basic Principles
1. All magic requires both forces
2. Power comes from their interaction
3. Imbalance leads to instability
4. Natural world maintains equilibrium
5. Users channel, not create, power

## Magic Users
- Shapers: Focus on controlled manipulation
- Weavers: Blend both forces
- Breakers: Exploit force imbalances
- Preservers: Maintain magical balance

## The Cataclysm's Impact
The Aether Surge occurred when the balance between Entropy and Stasis was severely disrupted, leading to:
- Magical anomalies
- Changed landscapes
- New magical phenomena
- Lasting environmental effects

## Magical Climate Influences

1. Aether Currents: Invisible flows of magical energy that can affect weather patterns. Strong currents can cause:
   - Sudden temperature changes
   - Localized rain or snow in otherwise dry areas
   - Aurora-like phenomena in the sky

2. Mana Storms: Intense magical disturbances that manifest as extreme weather events:
   - Can occur in any climate zone
   - Often accompanied by temporary changes in local flora and fauna
   - Duration: Few hours to several days

3. Elemental Nodes: Concentrations of elemental magic that influence the surrounding environment:
   - Fire nodes can create local hot spots in cold regions
   - Water nodes can form oases in deserts
   - Air nodes can cause persistent wind patterns
   - Earth nodes can affect local topography and mineral distribution

4. Seasonal Flux: Some regions experience magical seasons in addition to natural ones:
   - "Bloom Tide" in parts of the Verdant Belt: Accelerated plant growth
   - "Frost Whisper" in the Frostpeak Range: Period of intense cold and ice magic manifestation
   - "Mirage Season" in the Sunscorch Wastes: Increased occurrences of magical illusions

These magical influences create a dynamic and unpredictable element to Aethoria's climate, challenging both inhabitants and the anti-magic organizations trying to maintain control.

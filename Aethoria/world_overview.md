## World History

- **Ancient Era** (10,000 - 5,000 years ago): Magic flourished, and great civilizations rose and fell. The ruins of these magical societies still dot the landscape.

- **Cataclysm** (5,000 years ago): A magical disaster known as the "Aether Surge" caused widespread destruction and chaos, reshaping parts of the world.

- **Age of Reckoning** (5,000 - 3,000 years ago): Survivors blamed uncontrolled magic for the cataclysm. This period saw the rise of anti-magic sentiments and the formation of the first magic-regulating bodies.

- **Era of Suppression** (3,000 - 1,000 years ago): Magic was systematically outlawed and suppressed across most of Aethoria. The anti-magic organization known as the "Aether Wardens" was founded during this time.

- **Age of Progress** (1,000 years ago - present): Technological advancements began to fill the void left by magic. However, magic use persists in the shadows, and tensions between magic users and authorities continue to simmer.

- **Recent History** (last 100 years): The discovery of "Aether-tech," a fusion of technology and controlled magical energy, has reignited debates about the place of magic in society.
